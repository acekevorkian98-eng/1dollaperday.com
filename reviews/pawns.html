                    <!-- INTRO -->
                    <section>
                        <h2>What is Pawns.app?</h2>
                        <p>Pawns.app (formerly known as IPRoyal Pawns) is a bandwidth sharing application that pays you for sharing your unused internet bandwidth. If you've heard of Honeygain, this is the same concept - you install an app, it runs in the background, and companies pay to route their traffic through your residential IP address.</p>

                        <p>"Why would anyone pay for my internet?" Good question. Businesses need residential IP addresses for legitimate purposes like market research, price comparison, ad verification, and SEO monitoring. Your home IP looks different from a data center IP, which makes it valuable for these use cases.</p>

                        <p>Pawns.app is operated by IPRoyal, a company that provides proxy services to businesses. They essentially act as the middleman - businesses pay IPRoyal for residential proxies, and IPRoyal pays you for providing the bandwidth. It's a win-win-win, assuming you're comfortable with the concept (more on that later).</p>

                    </div>

                    <!-- HOW IT WORKS -->
                    <section>
                        <h2>How Pawns.app Works</h2>

                        <h3>The Setup Process</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Create an account:</strong> Sign up at pawns.app (free).</li>
                            <li><strong>Download the app:</strong> Available for Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and as a Docker container.</li>
                            <li><strong>Install and run:</strong> The app runs in the background, using idle bandwidth.</li>
                            <li><strong>Earn passively:</strong> You're paid based on how much bandwidth is used through your connection.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cash out:</strong> Once you hit $5, withdraw via PayPal, Bitcoin, or gift cards.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>What the App Actually Does</h3>
                        <p>When running, Pawns.app:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Routes traffic from IPRoyal's business clients through your internet connection</li>
                            <li>Uses your residential IP address (which has value for market research)</li>
                            <li>Runs in the background with minimal resource usage</li>
                            <li>Only uses bandwidth when there's demand from clients</li>
                        </ul>

                        <div class="info-box neutral">
                            <p class="info-box-title">Payment Rates</p>
                            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Pawns.app pays approximately <strong>$0.20 per GB</strong> shared, though this varies by location. US and European IPs typically earn more because there's higher demand. Some users report rates up to $0.30/GB in premium locations.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h3>Additional Earning Methods</h3>
                        <p>Beyond bandwidth sharing, Pawns.app has added extra earning options:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Surveys:</strong> Complete surveys for additional earnings (separate from bandwidth)</li>
                            <li><strong>Referrals:</strong> Earn 10% of your referrals' lifetime bandwidth earnings</li>
                        </ul>
                    </section>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Realistic Earnings</h2>
                        <p>Let's set realistic expectations. Bandwidth sharing apps don't make much money - they make <em>some</em> money for doing literally nothing. Here's what to expect:</p>

                                <li><strong>ISP Terms of Service:</strong> Some ISPs prohibit reselling bandwidth. Check your agreement.</li>
                                <li><strong>Theoretically concerning:</strong> While companies like IPRoyal claim to filter malicious traffic, you're trusting them to do so.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                        <p>That said, Pawns.app and similar services claim to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Filter out illegal or malicious traffic</li>
                            <li>Only allow legitimate business use cases</li>
                            <li>Monitor their network for abuse</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>The beermoney community has used Pawns.app for years without widespread reports of problems. But you should make an informed decision about whether the small earnings are worth the theoretical risks.</p>

                            <li><strong>Run on multiple devices:</strong> Desktop, laptop, old phones - each device can earn separately.</li>
                            <li><strong>Stack with other bandwidth apps:</strong> Pawns.app + Honeygain + EarnApp can all run simultaneously on the same device.</li>
                            <li><strong>Keep devices online:</strong> The more uptime, the more earning opportunities.</li>
                            <li><strong>Use your best location:</strong> If you have access to US or EU connections, prioritize those.</li>
                            <li><strong>Try the survey feature:</strong> Small extra earnings, but they add up.</li>
                            <li><strong>Refer friends:</strong> 10% lifetime commission is generous for passive income apps.</li>
                            <li><strong>Be patient:</strong> Reaching the $5 minimum takes time with a single device. Don't check daily - check monthly.</li>

                            <p class="info-box-title">Verdict: Recommended for Passive Income Stacks</p>
                            <p>Pawns.app is a solid bandwidth sharing app with a competitive $5 minimum payout and reliable payment history. It won't make you rich - expect $1-5 per month depending on your setup - but it's legitimate passive income for doing literally nothing. The ability to stack it with Honeygain and other similar apps makes it worth running.</p>
                            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Best for:</strong> Anyone interested in passive income who understands and accepts the bandwidth-sharing model. Ideal when combined with other bandwidth apps for maximum earnings. If you're in the US or EU, you'll earn more. Just understand what you're signing up for and check your ISP's terms of service.</p>
