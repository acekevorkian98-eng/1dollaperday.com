                    <section>
                        <h2>What is Ibotta?</h2>
                        <p>Here's a question: how much do you spend on groceries each month? $300? $500? $800? Now imagine getting 2-5% of that back in cash, just for scanning your receipts. That's Ibotta in a nutshell - it's free money on stuff you're buying anyway.</p>

                        <p>Ibotta is a cashback app focused primarily on groceries and everyday purchases. Founded in 2012 and based in Denver, they've paid out over <strong>$1.5 billion</strong> to users. Unlike general cashback sites like Rakuten, Ibotta specializes in brand-specific offers - think "$1 off Cheerios" or "$0.50 back on Coca-Cola products."</p>

                        <p>The company went public in 2024 (NYSE: IBTA), which tells you something about their legitimacy. This isn't a startup that might disappear - it's a billion-dollar public company with millions of active users. If you buy groceries in the US and you're not using Ibotta, you're leaving money on the table every single week.</p>

                    <!-- HOW IT WORKS -->
                    <section>
                        <h2>How Ibotta Works</h2>
                        <p>Ibotta has evolved from just a receipt-scanning app to a multi-channel cashback platform. Here's how to use it:</p>

                        <h3>Method 1: Receipt Scanning (Traditional)</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Open the Ibotta app before shopping</li>
                            <li>Browse available offers and "add" the ones you plan to buy</li>
                            <li>Shop at any supported store (Walmart, Target, Kroger, etc.)</li>
                            <li>After shopping, scan your receipt with the app</li>
                            <li>Cashback automatically credited to your account</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Method 2: Linked Loyalty Cards (Automatic)</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Link your grocery store loyalty cards to Ibotta</li>
                            <li>Add offers in the app</li>
                            <li>Shop and use your loyalty card at checkout</li>
                            <li>Cashback applies automatically - no scanning needed!</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Method 3: Pay with Ibotta</h3>
                        <p>Ibotta now has a payment feature where you can pay directly through the app at certain retailers for instant cashback.</p>

                        <div class="info-box success">
                            <p class="info-box-title">Link Your Loyalty Cards</p>
                            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">The loyalty card linking feature is a game-changer. Once linked, you don't need to scan receipts - cashback happens automatically. Currently works with Walmart, Kroger, Albertsons, CVS, Dollar General, Family Dollar, and many more. This is the "set it and forget it" approach.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h3>Types of Offers</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Brand-specific:</strong> "$1.00 back on Tide Pods" - must buy that exact brand</li>
                            <li><strong>Any brand:</strong> "$0.25 back on any milk" - any brand qualifies</li>
                            <li><strong>Bonuses:</strong> "Buy 5 items from this list, get $3 bonus" - encourages multiple purchases</li>
                            <li><strong>Retailer bonuses:</strong> "Shop at Walmart this week, get $0.50 back on any receipt"</li>
                            <li><strong>Online shopping:</strong> Cash back on online orders from supported retailers</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Realistic Savings</h2>
                        <p>Let's be honest about what Ibotta will actually save you:</p>

                                </tr>
                                <tr>

                                    <td>$500-800</td>
                                    <td>$25 - $50+</td>
                                </tr>
                                <tr>

                            <p class="info-box-title">It's About Consistency, Not Windfalls</p>
                            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Ibotta won't make you rich. But $20-30/month is $240-360/year. Over 5 years, that's over $1,000 in free money for something that takes 2 minutes per shopping trip. The key is making it a habit - check offers before shopping, scan receipts after.</p>

                        <p>Ibotta is as legitimate as cashback apps get. They went public in 2024, meaning their finances are audited and transparent. Major brands like Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola, and Kraft Heinz partner with them directly. This isn't some fly-by-night operation - it's a major player in the rebate industry.</p>

                        <h2>Tips for Maximizing Savings</h2>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Link every loyalty card you have:</strong> Kroger, CVS, Walmart+, Target Circle - link them all for automatic cashback.</li>
                            <li><strong>Check "Any Brand" offers first:</strong> These are the most flexible and often apply to cheaper store brands.</li>
                            <li><strong>Complete bonus offers:</strong> "Buy 5 participating items, get $5" deals have excellent return rates.</li>
                            <li><strong>Don't buy things just for cashback:</strong> A $1 rebate on a $5 item you don't need is still $4 wasted.</li>
                            <li><strong>Scan receipts immediately:</strong> Offers expire, and you might forget details later.</li>
                            <li><strong>Stack strategically:</strong> Store sale + manufacturer coupon + Ibotta = maximum savings.</li>
                            <li><strong>Use the browser extension:</strong> Get cashback on online grocery orders too.</li>
                            <li><strong>Refer friends:</strong> Both parties get bonuses, and it adds up.</li>

                        <p><strong>The verdict?</strong> Use both Ibotta and Fetch Rewards together. Ibotta gives better cashback on specific items; Fetch gives points on every receipt. They stack - scan the same receipt in both apps for double rewards.</p>

                            <p class="info-box-title">Verdict: Highly Recommended (Must-Have for US Grocery Shoppers)</p>
                            <p>Ibotta is a no-brainer for anyone who buys groceries in the US. It's free, takes minimal effort (especially with linked loyalty cards), and provides real cash back on things you're buying anyway. The $20 minimum is slightly annoying, but you'll hit it within a month or two of regular use.</p>
                            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Best for:</strong> Every US household that buys groceries. Families and heavy shoppers will see the biggest returns. Link your loyalty cards, check offers before shopping, and let the savings accumulate. Combined with Fetch Rewards, you're maximizing every grocery run.</p>
