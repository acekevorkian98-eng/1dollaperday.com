                        <h2 id="the-experiment">The Experiment: No Hype, Just Numbers</h2>
                        <p>Every PTC site and crypto faucet promises you can "earn money online." YouTube thumbnails show people holding stacks of cash next to their laptops. Reddit threads argue back and forth about whether any of it is worth the electricity to keep your browser open.</p>

                        <p>So we decided to settle it. For 30 consecutive days &mdash; January 15 to February 13, 2026 &mdash; we tracked every single satoshi, every cent, every fraction of a token earned from PTC sites and crypto faucets. No referral earnings included. No offerwall bonuses. Just pure clicking, claiming, and watching ads.</p>

                        <p>We wanted to answer one question: <strong>if you're a regular person with no referrals, no following, and no special tricks, how much can you actually earn?</strong></p>

                        <div class="info-box warning">
                            <p class="info-box-title">Important Context</p>
                            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">All crypto amounts were converted to USD at the time of each daily tally. BTC hovered between $92K&ndash;$98K during our test period. Your results will vary depending on crypto prices, your country, ad availability, and how consistently you show up.</p>

                        <h2 id="setup">The Setup: Sites, Rules &amp; Daily Routine</h2>

                        <h3>Sites Tested</h3>
                        <p>We selected 8 platforms &mdash; a mix of established PTC sites and popular crypto faucets &mdash; that we'd already verified as legitimate payers:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>PTC Sites:</strong> CoinPayU, adBTC, MakeYouTask, LuckyWatch.Pro</li>
                            <li><strong>Crypto Faucets:</strong> FireFaucet, FaucetCrypto, VieFaucet, Faucetoshi</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Ground Rules</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>PTC ads and faucet claims only.</strong> No offerwalls, no surveys, no shortlinks. We wanted to isolate what these sites pay for their core activity.</li>
                            <li><strong>No referral earnings.</strong> Every cent reported is from our own clicks and claims.</li>
                            <li><strong>Maximum 60 minutes per day.</strong> We capped our total daily time across all 8 sites. Most days we finished in 35&ndash;50 minutes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Daily logging.</strong> Every session was timed. Every earning was recorded in a spreadsheet.</li>
                            <li><strong>All payouts collected via FaucetPay.</strong> This kept everything in one place for accurate tracking.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>The Daily Routine</h3>
                        <p>Here's roughly how a typical session looked:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Open all 8 sites in tabs (~1 minute)</li>
                            <li>Claim faucets on FireFaucet, FaucetCrypto, VieFaucet, Faucetoshi (~5 minutes)</li>
                            <li>Click through PTC ads on CoinPayU (~8&ndash;12 minutes, depending on ad count)</li>
                            <li>Click through PTC ads on adBTC (~5&ndash;8 minutes)</li>
                            <li>Complete tasks/ads on MakeYouTask (~5&ndash;10 minutes)</li>
                            <li>Watch videos on LuckyWatch.Pro (~5&ndash;10 minutes, mostly passive)</li>
                            <li>Return to faucets for second claims if timers have reset (~3 minutes)</li>
                            <li>Log everything, close tabs (~2 minutes)</li>
                        </ol>
                    </section>

                    <div class="ad-placeholder banner"></div>

                    <section>
                        <h2 id="week-by-week">Week-by-Week Breakdown</h2>

                        <h3>Week 1 (Days 1&ndash;7): The Learning Curve</h3>
                        <p>The first few days were the slowest. We were still figuring out optimal timing for faucet claims, which PTC ads were worth waiting for, and how to juggle 8 tabs without losing track.</p>

                        </div>

                        <p>Week 1 total: <strong>$2.03</strong>. That's about 29 cents a day. Not exactly life-changing. But we were still optimizing.</p>

                        <h3>Week 2 (Days 8&ndash;14): Finding the Rhythm</h3>
                        <p>By week 2, we'd developed a system. We knew which CoinPayU ads paid the most per view time, which faucets to claim first while timers ran on others, and that LuckyWatch worked best as background noise while doing other tasks.</p>

                        <p>FaucetCrypto's level system started kicking in &mdash; higher levels mean slightly better faucet rewards. FireFaucet's auto-faucet also became more productive as we'd banked ACP (Auto Claim Points) from the first week.</p>

                        <p>Week 2 total: <strong>$2.73</strong>. A 34% improvement just from getting efficient. Daily average climbed to about 39 cents.</p>

                        <h3>Week 3 (Days 15&ndash;21): The Plateau</h3>
                        <p>This is where things got interesting &mdash; or rather, predictable. Earnings leveled out. We'd squeezed about as much as we could from pure PTC and faucet activity. The numbers barely moved from week 2.</p>

                        <p>Week 3 total: <strong>$2.81</strong>. Daily average: $0.401. Only a 3% improvement over week 2.</p>

                        <p>This is the reality most "how to earn online" videos won't show you. There's a hard ceiling on PTC and faucet income that you hit fast.</p>

                        <h3>Week 4 + Days 29&ndash;30 (Days 22&ndash;30): Steady State</h3>
                        <p>The final stretch confirmed what week 3 told us. Earnings were consistent but flat. We had two slightly better days when CoinPayU had a batch of higher-paying ads, and one slower day when several faucets had reduced payouts (likely due to BTC price dipping briefly).</p>

                        <p>Week 4 + final 2 days total: <strong>$3.65</strong> (9 days). Daily average: $0.406.</p>

                        <h2 id="surprises">What Surprised Us (And What Didn't)</h2>

                        <h3>Surprise #1: CoinPayU Was the Highest Earner</h3>
                        <p>We expected FaucetCrypto or FireFaucet to lead. But CoinPayU's PTC ads consistently paid more per click than anything else. Some ads were worth 50&ndash;150 satoshis each, and there were usually 15&ndash;30 available per day. The catch? Each ad requires a 10&ndash;30 second viewing timer, which is why it ate the most time.</p>

                        <h3>Surprise #2: The First Week Was 30%+ Worse</h3>
                        <p>Experience genuinely matters. Knowing when to claim, which ads to prioritize, and how to run multiple sites in parallel made a measurable difference. If you try this for three days and quit, you're seeing the worst possible version of these earnings.</p>

                        <h3>Surprise #3: Faucets Are More Consistent Than PTC</h3>
                        <p>PTC earnings fluctuated quite a bit day to day. Some days CoinPayU had 30 ads; some days it had 12. Faucets, on the other hand, paid almost the exact same amount every day. Less exciting, but more predictable.</p>

                        <h3>Not a Surprise: It's Not Much Money</h3>
                        <p>Let's be blunt. $10.92 in 30 days is not going to pay your rent. It's not going to cover your groceries. At $0.49/hour, it's a fraction of minimum wage in any developed country. Anyone telling you otherwise is selling something.</p>

                        <div class="info-box danger">
                            <p class="info-box-title">Reality Check</p>
                            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">If you're in a first-world country and your goal is to maximize income per hour, PTC and faucets are one of the worst ways to do it. A part-time job, freelancing on Fiverr, or even selling stuff on eBay will earn you 20&ndash;50x more per hour.</p>

                        <p>Despite the low numbers, there are situations where PTC and faucets genuinely make sense:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Developing countries:</strong> $0.36/day goes further in some economies than others. In parts of Africa, Southeast Asia, and South America, this can cover a meal or phone data. We have readers who stack multiple micro-earning methods to earn $2&ndash;5/day, which is meaningful in their local economy.</li>
                            <li><strong>Students and teens:</strong> If you can't get a formal job yet, PTC sites are one of the few ways to earn any money online with zero investment and no age restrictions (on most platforms).</li>
                            <li><strong>Crypto accumulation:</strong> If you believe BTC or other cryptos will appreciate significantly, accumulating small amounts now via faucets is a zero-risk way to build a position. People who claimed from Bitcoin faucets in 2014&ndash;2016 are sitting on small fortunes today.</li>
                            <li><strong>Learning the ecosystem:</strong> PTC and faucets teach you about crypto wallets, microtransactions, and the online earning landscape. They're a gateway to higher-paying methods like offerwalls and surveys.</li>
                            <li><strong>Building referral networks:</strong> The real money in PTC isn't clicking &mdash; it's referring. But you need to use the platforms yourself to credibly recommend them.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Our test deliberately excluded referral earnings. But here's the thing &mdash; referrals are the entire business model of PTC. The platforms are designed to make active clicking barely profitable so that you're incentivized to recruit others.</p>

                        <p>Let's run the math on what our $10.92/month would look like with referrals:</p>

                        <p>With 50 active referrals across your platforms &mdash; difficult but not impossible for someone with a blog, YouTube channel, or social media presence &mdash; you'd be looking at close to $100/month. Now it starts to feel like something.</p>

                            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">These estimates assume each referral earns roughly the same as we did ($10.92/month) and platforms average ~15% referral commission. Real numbers will vary &mdash; not all referrals stay active, and commission rates differ per platform. MakeYouTask and FaucetCrypto offer up to 20%, while others offer 10%.</p>

                        <p>After 30 days, here's what we learned about squeezing the most out of this:</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Use a dedicated browser profile.</strong> Set up a separate Chrome profile with all 8 sites bookmarked. Open them all with one click. Saves 2&ndash;3 minutes per session.</li>
                            <li><strong>Claim faucets first, PTC second.</strong> Start faucet timers immediately so they're ready for a second claim by the time you're done with PTC ads.</li>
                            <li><strong>Prioritize CoinPayU's highest-value ads.</strong> Sort by payout value. The 100+ satoshi ads are worth waiting for. Skip the 1&ndash;5 sat ones unless you're out of better options.</li>
                            <li><strong>Let LuckyWatch run passively.</strong> Open it in a background tab while you work on other sites. It's video-based, so it earns without active attention.</li>
                            <li><strong>Level up on FaucetCrypto.</strong> The first few weeks are the weakest. Stick with it &mdash; higher levels genuinely pay better faucet rewards.</li>
                            <li><strong>Set up FaucetPay as your hub.</strong> Most of these sites pay through <a href="../reviews/faucetpay">FaucetPay</a>. Having one central wallet simplifies everything.</li>
                            <li><strong>Don't skip days.</strong> Consistency compounds. Daily streaks and level progress mean week 4 pays more than week 1.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>Having spent 30 days on both, here's the honest comparison:</p>

                        </div>

                        <p>Our verdict: <strong>use both</strong>. PTC sites are your main earners; faucets fill the gaps while timers count down. They complement each other better than either works alone.</p>

                        <p>If you don't want to juggle 8 sites, here's where we'd focus:</p>

                        <h3>Best Overall: CoinPayU + FaucetCrypto</h3>
                        <p>CoinPayU was our top earner, and FaucetCrypto has the best long-term reward scaling. Together, they accounted for over a third of our total earnings and took only 15 minutes combined.</p>

                        <p>The auto-faucet earned while we were doing other things. If you want the laziest possible setup, bank some ACP and let FireFaucet do its thing in the background.</p>

                        <p>Up to 20% lifetime commission, incredibly low payout threshold, and the most modern interface. If you're going to recommend one platform to friends, MakeYouTask is the easiest sell.</p>

                        <p>If we ran this experiment again:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Include offerwalls.</strong> Our test excluded them for purity, but offerwalls on MakeYouTask and FaucetCrypto could have easily doubled or tripled total earnings. A 30-day test with offerwalls included would tell a very different story.</li>
                            <li><strong>Run during a bull market.</strong> Crypto prices were relatively stable during our test. In a strong bull run, faucet rewards (denominated in crypto) become worth more in USD even if the sat amounts don't change.</li>
                            <li><strong>Add Freecash.</strong> We focused on PTC/faucet-only platforms, but <a href="../reviews/freecash">Freecash</a> combines PTC elements with high-paying offerwalls. It probably would have been our top earner by a wide margin.</li>
                            <li><strong>Track referral growth from day one.</strong> We deliberately excluded referrals, but the multiplier effect is where PTC/faucets transform from "pocket change" to "actual income."</li>
                        </ul>

                            <p class="info-box-title">Bottom Line</p>
                            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">In 30 days of dedicated PTC and faucet work (~45 minutes/day), we earned <strong>$10.92</strong>. That's real money, really paid out, and really in our FaucetPay wallet. It's not much &mdash; but it's honest, it's consistent, and for some people in some situations, it matters. The key insight: treat PTC and faucets as a <em>starting point</em>, not a destination. Use them to learn the ecosystem, build referrals, and eventually move into higher-paying methods like offerwalls and GPT sites. The people who earn real money from PTC didn't stop at clicking ads &mdash; they built something on top of it.</p>
